# Baseer: Vision Through Audio

Welcome to the **Baseer: Vision Through Audio** GitHub repository. This project is part of our **Software Engineering Course** at **Zewail City of Science and Technology**. The aim is to enhance the lives of visually impaired individuals by providing tools to navigate their environment using auditory feedback.

## Project Overview
